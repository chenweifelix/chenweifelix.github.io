**I am a first-year PhD student in _Human Development and Social Policy_ at _Northwestern University_, and my research interests revolve around emotion and motivation.** 

Some of the high-level questions that guide my current research are: 

  1. Whether and how people's motivation underlying emotion regulation (e.g., emotion desirability and controllability beliefs, emotion goals) relates to the outcomes of the short-lived emotion episodes and long-term well-being? 
  
  2. What is the role of emotions in long-term goal pursuits? (e.g., Do people strategically pursue want-to goals as a means to up-regulate positive emotions? How do people regulate the aversive affective feature of temptations in service of the pursuit of long-term goals?) 
  
  3. How is emotion regulated in interpersonal relationships, and how is interpersonal relationship conducive or harmful to emotional well-being and goal pursuits?  
  
  4. How social class shapes people's motivation for as well as the outcomes of emotion and self-regulation?  

If any of these questions sound intrgiuing to you, feel free to send me an email to chat!

I use a variety of methods to address my research questions, with an expertise in quantitative survey methodology. My work is both exploratory and confirmatory in nature, and I value both predictability and explainability.
