**I am a first-year PhD student in _Human Development and Social Policy_ at _Northwestern University_, and my research interests revolve around emotion and motivation.** 

Some of the high-level questions that guide my current research are: 

  1. Whether and how people's motivation underlying emotion regulation (e.g., emotion desirability and controllability beliefs, emotion goals) relates to the outcomes of the short-lived emotion episodes and long-term well-being? 
  
  2. What is the role of emotions in long-term goal pursuits? (e.g., Do people strategically pursue want-to goals as a means to up-regulate positive emotions? How do people regulate the aversive affective feature of temptations in service of the pursuit of long-term goals?) 
  
  3. How is emotion regulated in interpersonal relationships? and 
  
  4. How is interpersonal relationship conducive or harmful to emotional well-being and goal pursuits?   

I use a variety of methods to address my research questions, with a particular interest in _survey methodology_. I have intensive training in creating psychometrically sound measures along with validating and refining existing ones. I am also well-trained in fitting models that are both statistically correct and grounded in psychological theories to the data. My work is both exploratory and confirmatory in nature, and I value both predictability and explanbility.
