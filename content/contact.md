# My research interests revolve around emotion and motivation. 

My research interests revolve around emotion and motivation, and the intra- as well as inter-personal regulation of each. Some of the high-level questions that guide my current research are: (1) Whether and how people's motivation underlying emotion regulation (e.g., emotion desirability and controllability beliefs, emotion goals) relates to the outcomes of the short-lived emotion episodes and long-term well-being? (2) What is the role of emotions in long-term goal pursuits? (e.g., Do people strategically pursue want-to goals as a means to up-regulate positive emotions? How do people regulate the aversive affective feature of temptations in service of the pursuit of long-term goals?) (3) How is emotion regulated in interpersonal relationships? (4) How is interpersonal relationship conducive or harmful to emotional well-being and goal pursuits?
